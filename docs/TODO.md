**Status**: Core replace functionality complete! (Nov 2025)

**Completed:**
- ✅ Streaming search (literal & regex) - efficient on GB+ files
- ✅ Search UI (F3/Shift+F3)
- ✅ Wrap-around, highlighting, incremental search
- ✅ **Replace functions** (Nov 2025):
  - `replace_range()` - Replace specific byte range

  - `replace_all()` - Replace all occurrences (literal strings)
  - `replace_all_regex()` - Replace all with regex capture groups (${1}, ${2})
- ✅ **Replace UI** (Ctrl+R) - Emacs-like two-step prompts:
  - With active search: directly prompts for replacement
  - Without active search: prompts for search query, then replacement
  - Incremental highlighting during search input
- ✅ **Property-based tests** - 11 tests, 1,100 cases covering all replace functions
- ✅ **Search in selection** (Nov 2025) - Limit search to selected range, no wrap-around

- [x] Extract commands & prompts (~335 lines → 2 modules)
- [ ] Create BufferView abstraction (~500 lines)
- [ ] Extract multi-cursor operations (~200 lines)
- [ ] Split large modules (editor.rs is ~3000 lines)

### Test Infrastructure

- [ ] Fix BIG.txt generation timing (2 scrolling tests fail)
- [ ] Support independent buffers per split (if desired)
- [ ] Add more E2E tests for complex workflows
- [ ] Performance regression tests

## Architecture Notes

### Lazy-Edit Approach Analysis (Nov 2025)
**Status:** Analyzed and **NOT RECOMMENDED**

**Proposal**: Store edits in a Write-Ahead Log (WAL) and apply lazily when sections are viewed

**Problems Identified**:
- Position tracking cascade failure (cursors, markers, overlays all need complex region tracking)
- Multi-cursor consistency nightmare
- Line cache invalidation chaos
- Syntax highlighting corruption
- Memory overhead explosion
- Cascading materialization (save, search, etc. force full materialization anyway)
- WAL complexity and crash recovery issues

**Conclusion**: Current architecture (ChunkTree-based Rope with persistent structure) is well-designed. The "problem" (occasional `to_string()` calls) is fixable with streaming search (already implemented ✅). Lazy-edit would introduce massive complexity for no real benefit.

**Key Insight**: Current architecture already achieves:
- O(log n) edits via persistent tree
- O(viewport) rendering via chunked iteration
- O(1) undo/redo via structural sharing


**Architecture Summary**:
- **Layer 1 (ChunkTree)**: Persistent Rope structure with Arc-sharing (efficient edits, instant undo)
- **Layer 2 (VirtualBuffer)**: 16MB LRU cache + edit log for iterator position adjustment
- **Layer 3 (Buffer)**: Text operations, line cache, file I/O
- **Layer 4 (EditorState)**: EventLog for undo/redo + UI state
- **Layer 5 (Rendering)**: Iterator-based O(viewport) display

**Why it works**: Streaming search (✅ implemented Nov 2025) eliminates the `to_string()` bottleneck. No architectural changes needed.

**Files**: `src/chunk_tree.rs`, `src/virtual_buffer.rs`, `src/buffer.rs`, `src/chunked_search.rs`
